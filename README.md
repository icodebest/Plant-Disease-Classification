# Real-Time Plant Disease Classification Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based system for real-time classification of plant diseases. The system helps farmers and agricultural professionals quickly identify plant health issues through image analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Framework for building and training the deep learning model.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing.
- **Flask**: To create a web interface for user interaction.

## Features
- Real-time classification of plant diseases.
- User-friendly interface for image upload.
- High accuracy achieved through a convolutional neural network (CNN).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (can be installed via `requirements.txt`):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
